# spur-gear-gen
CAD wrapped spur gear generator

To compile requires Visual Studio 2015 and MFC. However, all of the CAD work is done with boost, and with no Microsoft dependence, so should cross platform easily. This is version 0.1 Achievements for 1.0 status would be a reasonable user interface and an installer package.

Read the how_to_build.txt in the project folder. It should all be complete and there should be no depenances on my machine
